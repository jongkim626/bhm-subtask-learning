# bhm-subtask-learning
A realistic task is large and complex. The learning curve of such a task generally follows a nonlinear relationship between performance (error rates) and practice, which is summarized as a power function. The task can be decomposed into a smaller unit of a task (i.e., a subtask). We are investigation the learning rates of subtasks. 

Based on the Dismal spreadsheet task data (Kim & Ritter, 2015), we seek to investigate a deeper understanding about the process of learning and forgetting. Particularly, a Bayesian hierarchical approach is considered to model the learning effect by subtasks and by subjects. R adn Stan are used for this analysis.
